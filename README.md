Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Computer Science student passionate about learning and improving in the field of software development. My focus is primarily on C++ and Rust, and I have some experience with Golang, C#, Dart, SQL, and simple Vue development (thanks to a class I took). Currently, I am diving into Python for AI and Data Analysis tasks.

What I'm working on
I'm still in the early stages of my journey, creating small projects, which you can find in my repository. Although I havenâ€™t worked on large-scale projects yet, Iâ€™m constantly exploring and learning new technologies to deepen my skills. I aim to specialize in more advanced C++/Rust topics and avoid limiting myself to basic CRUD applications.

My goals
My ultimate goal is to expand my knowledge in AI and advanced software development. Right now, Iâ€™m preparing for my graduate school entrance exams while continuing to explore new tools and technologies.

Personal philosophy
I strongly believe that computing is created by humans, and if others can do it, so can I. Iâ€™m not afraid of any challenges that come my way, and Iâ€™m determined to keep pushing myself forward.

Skills:
C++: Most experienced
Rust: Learning and exploring
Python: AI & Data Analysis
Golang, C#, Dart: Familiar with
Vue: Basic Web development
Feel free to check out my small projects and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss any tech-related topics. Iâ€™m always open to learning and sharing ideas!
